				fun. Our Resort is equipped with full RV hook ups as well as spots for
				tent camping. We also have clean restrooms with hot showers conveniently

				allowing for more time to play and relax in the water. Plan on bringing
				your rafts, floats, coolers, and chairs to our day use area where you

				California skies.
